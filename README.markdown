OpenFeint-iOS-Framework
=======================

This is a simple XCode project which will build OpenFeint as a Static Framework. Once built it behaves and handles just like any framework but in reality it is a static library - which means it can be used for iOS.

Current OpenFeint version used: __2.8__
